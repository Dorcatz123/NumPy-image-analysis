## This project is about manipulating images using the NumPy library. I start the project with some basic refresher on numpy arrays and at the end I show how to play around with images, how to change the color, how to flip the image and rotate it etc. This project is a part of the course I did in Udemy https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/. All the solutions provided are unique.
