## This project is about manipulating images using the NumPy library. I start the project with some basic refresher on numpy arrays and at the end I show how to play around with images, to change its color, to flip the image and to rotate the image etc. This project is a part of the course I did in Udemy https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/. I have provided multiple solutions for the task involved and are different from what is being done in the course.
